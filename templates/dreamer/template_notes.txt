Template function and class declarations should be included in header file (.h),
but definition should be place in a separate file (.hpp).

Important!!!
At the end on header file, before #endif clause closing defintion of header file
the .hpp file should be included:
#include "templateDefinition.hpp"

Template specializations must be defined in the same namespace that contains the
original template. As with any other namespace name, so long as we have declared 
the specialization inside the namespace, we can define it outside the namespace.
