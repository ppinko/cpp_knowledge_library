We can prevent the use of a constructor in a context that requires an implicit 
conversion by declaring the constructor as 'explicit'. Now, neither constructor 
can be used to implicitly create an object of the class with 'explicit'
constructor.

The 'explicit' keyword is meaningful only on constructors that can be called 
with a single argument. Constructors that require more arguments are not used to
perform an implicit conversion, so there is no need to designate such
constructors as explicit. The explicit keyword is used only on the constructor
declaration inside the class. It is not repeated on a definition made outside
the class body.
