Pragma directive is a special purpose directive and is used to 
turn on or off some features. This type of directives are 
compiler-specific i.e., they vary from compiler to compiler. 

One of the most useful directive is:
#pragma once 
/*
The #pragma once directive has a very simple concept. The header 
file containing this directive is included only once even if the 
programmer includes it multiple times during a compilation. This 
is not included in any ISO C++ standard. This directive works 
similar to the #include guard idiom. Use of #pragma once saves 
the program from multiple inclusion optimisation.
